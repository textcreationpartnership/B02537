            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THAT where there being a Proceſs of Declarator of truſt raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the inſtance of the deceaſt Duke of <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> and <hi>John Cunningham</hi> of <hi>Enterkine</hi> before this preſent Parliament againſt the Creditors of <hi>Corſhill,</hi> Mr. <hi>David Cunningham</hi> Advocat and others for declaring that the Laird of <hi>Corſhill</hi> ſtood Infeft in the Eſtate of <hi>Robertland,</hi> for the deceaſt Duke of <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> and <hi>Enterkine</hi> and others mentioned in a Backbond granted be <hi>Corſhill</hi> to them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anent, or to their behoofe whom any of them contained in ſaid Backband ſhould nominat; And all the ſaids Creditors, and Mr. <hi>David Cunningham</hi> being cited, and the Proceſs called the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, The ſaids Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and the ſaid Mr. <hi>David Cunningham</hi> were appointed to ſee in the Clerks hands and be ready againſt the morrow thereafter, which Proceſs not being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, and <hi>Enterkine</hi> who was the laſt ſurviver, having conform to the Backband of truſt, declared that the foreſaid truſt was for your Petitioners behoofe; And your Petitioner having applyed to Your Grace and the Honourable Eſtates of Parliament, that a day might be prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for hearing of your Petitioners Procurators upon the ſaid truſt, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Committee for Private Affairs, It was ſome of the Committee their opinon that the Proceſs ought to be wakned, and the Creditors cited <hi>de novo.</hi> Whereas it is Humbly repreſented to Your Grace, and the Honourable Eſtates of Parliament, that Proceſſes before the Parliament cannot be ſaid to ſleep? unleſs the purſuer ſhould ſuffer a Seſſion of Parliament to interveen without proſecuting his Action, this being an undoubted principle in Law that <hi>contra vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentem agere non currit praeſeriptio.</hi> And the very continuing of the Seſſions of Parliament from time to time doth virtually contain a continuation of all cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es before the ſame, otherwayes the Leidges would be at continual expences and trouble for warrands for new Citations and Executing the ſame; And a great hazard, that ever their cauſes ſhould come in the Defenders taking all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wayes for poſtponing and delaying the ſamen as they have done in this caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it therefore pleaſe Your Grace, and Honourable Eſtates of Parliament, to allow the Committee to proceed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any new citation, upon an intimation to be given to Mr.</hi> Stewart <hi>&amp; Mr.</hi> Cunningham <hi>Advocats, who compears for the Creditors, and himſelf.</hi>
